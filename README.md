###Aleos User Manual

Hello user! Thank you so much for downloading Aleos, I hope you enjoy your time with it.

#####Setup Steps

So for starters, as of right now, Aleos has to be locally hosted (sorry about that), so please download node for your OS, which has been included in the download folder. Once you have node downloaded, the process is super simple, simply input:

npm install tone

Then hit enter or return, and you're set!

Once the download is complete, feel free to open the html file

#####The PowerPoint

Included in the download folder is also a powerpoint that gives the details of the current build, as well as the plans for the future.

#####Using Aleos

Aleos is a monophonic, generative synth, and in its current build, using Aleos is *incredibly* simple! You'll be presented with different boxes and a few buttons, all of which fall under one of the following categories:

* Note Probability
* Step Probability
* Tempo
* Play/Stop

Please see below for further description of each category.

#####Note Probability

As of right now, Aleos supports the C Major Scale (A=440). So, for each of the diatonic notes of the scale (C4-B4), you will see a label followed by (0-100) and a box (the box will default to 50). The number in the box represents the chance that any individual note has to sound. It should be noted, the program checks the notes in order, so the notes tend to slightly skew towards the lowest note possible even when all notes have the same percentage input.

#####Step Probability

This input represents the likelihood of any note being triggered at all on any given step. A step is a rhythmic interval of time, much like a beat.

#####Tempo

The tempo selection allows you to choose what tempo you'd like the steps to happen at. In other words, the tempo controls how fast or slow the notes will play. The tempo sets how often a *step* is triggered (see above).

#####Play/Stop

Well, these two buttons have the option to start and stop a sequence. You could probably guess which one does which.


#####Closing
Thank you so much again, and like I said, I really hope you get some value out of this thing. It's still in its infancy, and you can expect many more updates with fresh new features some time in the future. Unfortunately due to a combination of my schedule and skill, I can't guarantee how often these updates will occur, but they will nonetheless.

#####Special Thanks
Thank you so much Justin, Lucas, Nathaniel, Jon, Akito, and Mom and Dad
